# RCRPG - Clojure

An implementation in clojure of the simple game described [here](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/RCRPG/Perl) done for [rosettacode.org](http://rosettacode.org/)

## Notes

The implementation is similar to the one described for the Perl version, but with minor changes, like the command `attack` that is replaced by `dig` (like in the [Python implementation](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/RCRPG/Python))

rcrpg.clojure uses [leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) as project manager.

## rosettacode.org

<cite>"Rosetta Code is a [programming chrestomathy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrestomathy) site. The idea is to present solutions to the same task in as many different languages as possible, to demonstrate how languages are similar and different, and to aid a person with a grounding in one approach to a problem in learning another"</cite>
